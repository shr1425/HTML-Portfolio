<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Computer Science undergraduate at KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, I Shrusti Shripannavar , with a proven academic record (CGPA 9.4) and a passion for innovation, I am eager to contribute to Software Engineering and Machine Learning through an internship at the Max Planck Society. With a strong foundation in core computational principles and hands-on experience in impactful projects, I am confident in my ability to excel in this intellectually stimulating environment.</p>

<p>My academic journey has been marked by a commitment to excellence in both theoretical and applied domains of computer science. Courses like Data Structures, Algorithms, Database Management, and Object-Oriented Programming have sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills. I have further honed these skills through projects such as “Predicting Road Crash Severity,” where I applied Machine Learning algorithms to classify accident severity using complex and noisy datasets. This project deepened my expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization while underscoring the societal impact of predictive analytics. Similarly, my project “Maximum Revenue for Cab Drivers through Payment Type” demonstrated the transformative potential of data-driven decision-making in business optimization.</p>

<p>My dedication to academic and extracurricular pursuits has earned me several accolades, including the Reliance Foundation Undergraduate Scholarship and the Infosys STEM Scholarship. These achievements highlight my ability to consistently perform at the highest level. Beyond academics, my leadership roles as Group Captain in the National Service Scheme and Co-ordination Member for IEEE NKSS SAC have strengthened my ability to work collaboratively, lead multidisciplinary teams, and contribute meaningfully to collective goals. Through my role as an InternShala Student Partner, I further developed my communication and organizational skills, engaging with diverse student communities to promote learning initiatives.</p>
